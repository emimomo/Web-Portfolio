        <h3>Creative Statement</h3>

        <div class="description" id="author's statement">
          <p>The inspiration for “Disquiet” comes from the simple sounds within my backyard.
            On days of particularly bad anxiety attacks, I sit on a hammock in my backyard to
            read or simply listen to the quiet buzz of birds chirping, dogs playing, or neighbors
            tending their yards. The subdued sounds provide a quieting backdrop for my mind and
            help ground my thoughts in the present.
            </p>
          <p>My soundscape narrative strives to recreate these sounds to give the listener a sense
            of tranquility while also imitating the feeling of having intrusive thoughts through the
            buzzing of an annoying fly. I attempted to incorporate techniques for managing anxiety,
            such as breathing exercises in the respiratory quality of the wind, to help the listener
            relax. Listen as the wind blows through the trees and the windchimes sing their tranquil
            harmonies as I recreate my experience with anxiety through sounds within my backyard.
            </p>

          <h3> Creative Process and Inspiration </h3>

          <p>My soundscape narrative is representation of my experiences with anxiety. Growing up, I
            struggled with regulating my intrusive thoughts and establishing a peace mind. I had to find
            ways to manage my overactive thoughts and calm my body so that I wasn’t perpetually under stress.
            One method I found helped the most was finding a quiet place to just focus on my surroundings
            and ground myself in the moment so that I would stop worrying about both my past and my future.
            My soundscape narrative emulates the sounds in my backyard, where I would often go to relax, and
            incorporates methods of managing anxiety, such as breathing techniques and grounding. Simultaneously,
            the quiet tranquility of the wind, birds, and windchimes are interrupted by various other sounds
            within my backyard, particularly that of an annoying fly. The buzzing of the fly is symbolic of
            my intrusive thoughts and is meant to create a subtle conflict within the listener. Often, even
            when trying to relax, there are moments when the anxiety slips in. This constant battle has defined
            my experience with anxiety, and I want the listener to take away not only the calm atmosphere of my
            garden, but also the frequent and uncontrollable thoughts that cause stress and confusion. </p>

          <p>In terms of the technical elements, I found that cutting, splitting, and joining tracks were most
            useful for combining or sampling multiple sounds to create new and interesting effects. For example,
            the audio of the hose turning on and spraying water is a combination of three or four different sounds
            I found online. These were blended into one cohesive sound using the fade-in and fade-out effect, which
            was another tool I found handy for transitioning from one sound to another. One of the most challenging
            portions of this project was timing the sounds so that they produced a recognizable narrative that
            didn’t feel too rushed or too drawn out. The time shift tool was an integral tool that helped me achieve
            the narrative flow that I was looking for. Similarly, one of my core visions for this project was
            imitating the sound of inhaling and exhaling through the volume manipulation of the wind blowing through
            the trees. An essential technique for combatting anxiety is breathing – taking long, deep breathes through
            the nose and exhaling slowly from your mouth. This signals to your automatic nervous system that there is
            no imminent danger and forces your body to calm down. To imitate this sense, I used the envelope tool to
            increase and decrease the volume of the wind in equal intervals that resembled breathing. Although moving
            the points to change the volume was frustrating at times, I am proud of the overall effect I achieved
            using this tool. </p>

            <p>Overall, learning about different techniques and methods of audio manipulation throughout the creative
            process has been incredible. I love watching sound engineers, producers, and composers illustrate their
            work on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, so having the opportunity to be a part of that
            experience and create my own audio was exciting. Additionally, I think the creative process helped to build
            my confidence. Now I too have the skills on Audacity to create original pieces that I want to share with
            the world. That, to me, is one of the most exhilarating aspects of creating my soundscape project – having
            the freedom to create more with the technology available to me. </p>
