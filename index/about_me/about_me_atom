        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>Hi, I'm Emily Hann, undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh studying both
          anthropology and digital narrative and interactive design. This is my first website using HTML
          and CSS. I have always been interested in the interaction between humans and the digital world.
          We are constantly surrounded by digital media and the way we utilize and engage with others
          using technology is mediated by our cultural upbringing. My goal is to study how we interpret
          society, culture, and other individuals through the lens of the digital landscape. With this,
          we can continue to foster new online relationships that foster understanding, cultural exchange,
          and globalization.

        <h4>Anthropology</h4>

        <p>Through cross-cultural analysis and communication, I am qualified to conduct research
          that focuses on the culturally specific relationships between people, technology, and society.
          My goal is to not only to understand others and their behaviors and to describe their experiences
          accurately, but to share and build intercultural relationships that benefit both parties. In this
          way, I can approach digital design with a cultural lens that appropriately conveys information
          and enhances user experiences and interaction.
        </p>

        <h4>Digital Narrative and Interactive Design</h4>

        <p>Combining design, narrative, and coding, I am currently acquiring the hard skills required to
          produce interactive media experiences that use storytelling to convey information through human-computer
          interfaces. I have experience in programming languages Python, HTML, and CSS and editing software such
          as Audacity and Gimp, which I have used to create a variety of media for class projects. In combination
          with my anthropology degree, I hope to create rich cultural narratives through digital media that enhance
          cultural awareness and foster diversity, inclusion, and understanding within various communities.

        <p>I have successfully completed four semesters of intensive Japanese and hundreds

          Japanese not only allows me to communicate effectively with other Japanese speakers, but
          also introduced me to cultural concepts that exist only within Japan. As such, I have a
          specialized academic concentation in Japan and Japanese culture and East Asian cultures
          more broadly.

        <h3>Meet my Pets!</h3>

        <p> I have a Miniature Schnauzer named Tucker and my two wonderful cats Sara (left)
          and Nyx (right). My family adopted Sara when I was very young and, ever since then,
          she has been a faithful companion throughout my life. She, along with our family dog
          Tucker, are notorious in our house for stealing food when no one is looking. Tucker
          loves chewing sticks in our backyard and is an absolute menace to the local bunny
          population, who are often chased back into their tiny dens by his shrill bark. He also
          terrorizes our youngest cat, Nyx, who prefers to hide in cabinets and under beds rather
          than encounter Tucker's playful attitude. She won't hesitate to put up a fight if he
          gets too close though! All my pets have been beloved friends and family members and
          there's never a dull moment when they're around.
