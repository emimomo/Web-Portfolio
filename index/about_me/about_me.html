          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>Hi, I'm Emily Hann, undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh studying both
            anthropology and digital narrative and interactive design. This is my first website using HTML
            and CSS. I have always been interested in the interaction between humans and the digital world.
            We are constantly surrounded by digital media and the way we utilize and engage with others
            using technology is mediated by our cultural upbringing. My goal is to study how we interpret
            society, culture, and other individuals through the lens of the digital landscape. With this,
            we can continue to foster new online relationships that foster understanding, cultural exchange,
            and globalization.
          </p>

          <h4>Anthropology</h4>

          <p>Through cross-cultural analysis and communication, I am qualified to conduct research
            that focuses on the culturally specific relationships between people, technology, and society.
            My goal is to not only to understand others and their behaviors and to describe their experiences
            accurately, but to share and build intercultural relationships that benefit both parties. In this
            way, I can approach digital design with a cultural lens that appropriately conveys information
            and enhances user experiences and interaction.
          </p>

          <h4>Digital Narrative and Interactive Design</h4>

          <p>Combining design, narrative, and coding, I am currently acquiring the hard skills required to
            produce interactive media experiences that use storytelling to convey information through human-computer
            interfaces. I have experience in programming languages Python, HTML, and CSS and editing software such
            as Audacity and Gimp, which I have used to create a variety of media for class projects. In combination
            with my anthropology degree, I hope to create rich cultural narratives through digital media that enhance
            cultural awareness and foster diversity, inclusion, and understanding within various communities.

          <p>I have successfully completed four semesters of intensive Japanese and hundreds

            Japanese not only allows me to communicate effectively with other Japanese speakers, but
            also introduced me to cultural concepts that exist only within Japan. As such, I have a
            specialized academic concentation in Japan and Japanese culture and East Asian cultures
            more broadly.

            <h3>Meet my Pets!</h3>

            <p> I have a Miniature Schnauzer named Tucker and my two wonderful cats Sara (left)
              and Nyx (right). My family adopted Sara when I was very young and, ever since then,
              she has been a faithful companion throughout my life. She, along with our family dog
              Tucker, are notorious in our house for stealing food when no one is looking. Tucker
              loves chewing sticks in our backyard and is an absolute menace to the local bunny
              population, who are often chased back into their tiny dens by his shrill bark. He also
              terrorizes our youngest cat, Nyx, who prefers to hide in cabinets and under beds rather
              than encounter Tucker's playful attitude. She won't hesitate to put up a fight if he
              gets too close though! All my pets have been beloved friends and family members and
              there's never a dull moment when they're around.
