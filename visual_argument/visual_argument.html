  <!--VA Description-->
      <div class="description" id="author's statement">

        <p>“Every Child Counts” is an activist visual argument that brings awareness to
          the past atrocities First Nations peoples encountered while at residential schools.
          Recently, over 3,200 bodies were recovered from unmarked graves at residential schools
          across Canada and the U.S., who were likely victims of abuse and disease due to the
          mistreatment and poor sanitation at these facilities.
          </p>
        <p>In recognition of the tragic loss these children’s lives, my composition reflects
          imagery from the “Every Child Matters” movement currently sweeping across the nation.
          The use of the color orange, indicating the movement itself, along with images of butterflies
          – a symbol of transformation, the circle of life, and children in many indigenous cultures –
          generates solidarity in a time of collective grief from those communities this discovery impacts
          most.
          </p>
        <p>Rather than focus on the atrocities of residential schools itself, I wanted to highlight the
          sense of loss through the use of footprints. The larger footprints were inspired by the
          ink footprints infants receive on their birth certificate, prompting viewers to reflect
          on the children in their own lives. The smaller footprints, arranged in a sunburst
          pattern, plays with the idea of empty space to suggest that children, who were once
          here, have now disappeared, alluding to the sinister practices employed by residential
          schools.
          </p>
        <p>While viewing my visual argument, I urge the viewer to take their personal
          experiences into consideration to sympathize with the indigenous community as they
          mourn the loss of their ancestors.

      <h3> Creative Process and Inspiration </h3>

      <p>For my visual argument, I was inspired by recent discussions and indigenous movements around the discovery
        of thousands of unmarked child graves at residential schools across the U.S. and Canada. Although I am not
        personally from indigenous heritage, my anthropology background and interest in activism make me sympathetic
        to indigenous rights movements as a white ally. Considering this, the purpose of my visual argument was not
        to argue a particular position, as I felt that would be inappropriate given my social status, but rather to
        bring awareness to the pain and grief of the families of these children, who were murdered by institutions
        of cultural genocide.  </p>

      <p>Instead of focusing on the specific atrocities committed at residential schools, my visual argument aims
        to highlight the sense of loss these communities are experiencing through the use of the color orange,
        empty space, and symbolism. Using the color picker tool, I selected a shade of orange from the wings of a
        monarch butterfly and filled the background with this hue using the bucket tool. The color orange is a
        significant color in the “Every Child Matters” movement, as it indicates indigenous solidarity and a
        collective expression of grief in the community’s healing journey. In fact, my text, “Every Child Counts”
        was a derivative of their slogan; however, I wanted to suggest through the word “count” that every unmarked
        child grave “counts” toward the total death toll of the appalling practices at residential schools,
        referencing the injustice behind these murders. I personalized the font, size, and spacing to make the best
        use of visual space. Additionally, the monarch butterflies surrounding the text of my image are references
        to the symbology of butterflies in many native communities. The butterfly is a symbol of transformation and
        the circle of life and was often used to decorate children’s clothing and toys in some indigenous nations.
        I thought the connection between life and death as well as the transformative process alluded to the life
        that was taken away from the children at residential schools as well as the potential for healing and
        social reform through bringing awareness to this issue.  </p>

        <p>On a similar note, footprints were also a significant symbol throughout my visual argument. What are footprints?
          They are physical markers that indicate that someone existed within a specific time and space. The large ink
          footprints were inspired by the ink footprints provided on birth certificates, making the connection between
          children and the ephemeral nature of life. I used the fuzzy select tool and the intelligent scissors to
          extract these images from another file, then used the quick mask and paintbrush tools to clean up the edges
          of the selections. From there, I rotated and scaled the feet to artistically position them as the focal point
          of the composition. I also adjusted the hue, saturation, and lightness using the colorize feature to add
          warmth to the black and white images, which blended well with the orange background. From there, the smaller
          footprints were selected using the same method and given the same color as the background. I wanted the
          smaller footprints to “eat away” at the larger footprints, using empty space and repetition to simultaneously
          convey both existence and loss with the indigenous children. I basically copied and pasted the selection
          into new layers, adjusting the opacity each time, to create the illusion that the smaller footprints were
          slowly invading the larger footprints. Those layers were later merged together into one layer for the purpose
          of easing the editing process. The formation of the starburst pattern was also an artistic choice that I
          thought created balance through asymmetry, giving the visual a distinctly human touch and organic feel.
          Although my visual argument will only have meaning to those who are informed about this issue, I believe the
          striking imagery and overall design will spark public interest and awareness about the injustice of the
          residential school system while giving a visual space for indigenous families and community members to grieve
          and heal from their collective trauma. </p>
